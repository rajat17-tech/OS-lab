# Operating System Simulators Hub

A collection of interactive web-based simulators for visualizing and understanding core operating system concepts. These tools help students and enthusiasts learn through hands-on experimentation with real-time feedback and visual representations.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This project contains four comprehensive simulators that demonstrate different aspects of operating system functionality:

- **CPU Scheduling Simulator** - FCFS and SJF algorithms
- **OS Visual Guide** - Booting process, OS types, and system calls
- **RMS & EDF Scheduler** - Real-time scheduling algorithms
- **Synchronization Simulator** - Classic synchronization problems

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** all HTML files to a local directory
2. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser to access the main hub
3. **Click on any simulator** to launch it directly
4. **For best experience**, use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Recommended Setup
For the best development experience, use **VS Code with Live Server extension**:
```bash
# Install Live Server in VS Code
# Right-click on any HTML file and select "Open with Live Server"
